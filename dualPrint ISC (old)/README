This code is no longer maintained and corresponds to earlier versions of dualPrint I made using Illumination Software Creator, a now defunct visual programing environment that outputs source code to various languages and platforms.
These versions of dualPrint are kept here for historic pourposes and because, although the code is terrible, they are still very functional.
