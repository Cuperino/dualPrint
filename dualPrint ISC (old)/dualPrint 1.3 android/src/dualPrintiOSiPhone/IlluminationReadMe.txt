This project is built with Illumination Software Creator.  Below are a few items worth noting that cover how to run and test your iOS application.1) You must have a current copy of XCode and the iOS (iPhone / iPad) SDK installed.  You can find more information at: http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action2) On your Mac, with XCode installed, double click on the .xcodeproj file.  This will launch XCode and open your project.3) At this point you are all set!  Just hit 'Build and Run' from the XCode toolbar and you can run your new app in the iPhone simulator.Note - There is no technical difference between applications created with Illumination Software Creator, and those apps created with XCode alone.  Your application can be modified, run on actual iOS devices and even submited to the iTunes App Store.
